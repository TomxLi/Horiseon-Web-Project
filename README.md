"UW coding bootcamp 1st homework assignment - Code Refactor" from Xuefan Li

## Task

Modify and refactor existing code to improve accessibility, correct functionality, and meet semantic structure standard. 

## Motivation

It is one of the most common tasks for front-end and junior developers in real case scenario since web accessibility is an increasingly important according to instruction. I believe I will learn a lot of fundamentals of HTML and CSS and have a chance to apply what I have learned from the class into this project.

## How I did it

```
1. Carefully read through the code line by line.
2. Change inappropriate code to meet semantic structure standard. 
2. Combine repeated code, delete redundant code to make code cleaner.
3. Added description into the CSS file.
4. Added additional functions to make website more efficient.
```
